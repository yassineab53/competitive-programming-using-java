<h1>Competitive Programming With Java : Intro</h1>

Hello,

As you might know , Competitive Programming is a good way to polish your programming skills, and prepare for programming jobs, but for the most part it’s Fun.

in morocco Java is taught everywhere, every computer science student knows a little bit of Java , and the language is pretty popular in the competitive programming world , so i thought it would be a good idea to start a tutorial series , to try and teach you how to get started with Java in the competitive programming world .

So this series is going to cover a variety of topics regarding the language (i still don’t have a clear plan but well see ) .

Okay let me define important things first :

<h2><i>Why use Java ?</i></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Well as i said before you probably know a little of it, and even if you don’t it’s okay Java basics are easy to pic-up .</li>
    <li>Java is approved in all programming competitions  (ICPC … ) .</li>
    <li>Java has the best IDE Support Intellij and eclipse are great examples …</li>
    <li> Java is Fast (yes despite what people say) .</li>
</ul>

<h2><i>Audience of This serie :</i></h2>

This serie is for the people who knows a little bit of Java (variables, loops, conditionals…), and want to start doing some competitive programming , or the people who are using C++ and just want to know how things are done using Java .

I won’t be covering some hard algorithms i’m basically going to talk about the language features and how it can be used in Competitive programming .

<h2><i>Tutorials material :   </i></h2>
 
all the code is going to published to a public github repo as soon as the tutorial is live , so stay tuned .

Comments and ideas about possible topics are welcome .

That’s it for today . Happy Coding
