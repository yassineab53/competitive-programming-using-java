<h1>Competitive Programming with Java : IO</h1>
Hello,

In competitive programming, problems typically follow this format:

<i>You receive input in a specific format, and your task is to process this input to compute a result and produce output in a required format.</i>

In other words, for each competition or problem, you'll need to read input (from standard input or a file) and write output (to standard output or a file). Here’s how you can handle this in Java.
